Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = id (10000)
ii. Hours = business_id (1562)
iii. Category = business_id (2643)
iv. Attribute = business_id (1115)
v. Review = id (10000), business_id (8090), user_id (9581)
vi. Checkin = business_id (493)
vii. Photo = id (10000), business_id (6493)
viii. Tip = business_id (3979), user_id (537)
ix. User = id (10000)
x. Friend = user_id (11)
xi. Elite_years = user_id (2780)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

+-----------+--------------+------+---------------------+
(Output limit exceeded, 25 of 10000 total rows shown)

- That is because we can see from the yelping_since column that by 2007-07-19 compared to 2011-03-30,
  there were more fans in 2007 than 2011 but the reviews of the year 2011 are more than 2007.
  Therefore more reviews does not produce more fans.
	

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: The word "love" has more reviews

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

For the word love :

SELECT count(*) AS Love
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE '%love%'

For the word hate:

SELECT count(*) AS Hate
FROM review
WHERE text LIKE '%hate%'

	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT name
, id
, fans
FROM user
ORDER BY fans DESC
LIMIT 10
	
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+-----------+------------------------+------+
| name      | id                     | fans |
+-----------+------------------------+------+
| Amy       | -9I98YbNQnLdAmcYfb324Q |  503 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating.
   Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours? Yes they do.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews? Yes they do.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
   - No, because the postal codes are different.

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT  B.name
       ,C.category
	   ,B.city 
	   ,B.postal_code
	   ,hours , 
		CASE
		WHEN stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 stars'
		WHEN stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 stars'
		END AS rating,
		B.review_count AS reviews
       	FROM business B
		INNER JOIN hours H  ON B.id = H.business_id
		INNER JOIN category C ON C.business_id = B.id
		WHERE city = 'Toronto' AND category = 'Shopping' AND rating IN ('2-3 stars','4-5 stars')
		GROUP BY name
		ORDER BY stars DESC		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed?
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1: The average of the stores opened is greater than that of closed stores.
         
         
ii. Difference 2: The distinct number of business id of opened stores is greater than that of closed ones.
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id), 
		COUNT(DISTINCT city),
		AVG(stars), 
                AVG(review_count),
		is_open
	FROM business
	GROUP BY is_open	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the
   Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
- I will be analysing the shopping centre analysis, looking at things like is there business parking, is there bike parking,
    and is there wheelchair accessible at this shopping centre.
- I will be doing this analysis at the state "AZ". 
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

- Firstly I will use the 3 tables namely, business table, attribute table and category table. From these tables I will take state, stars, review_count, 
  value, attribute name and business name.

- I chose these type of data because they have a clear inference to the analysis I chose.                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
